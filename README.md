Miss Arancha, please read this:


Hello Arancha, I realized that I could create one file or several files
per exercise that you assign to me in Classroom. So instead of creating
a new folder with a new Java project every time I do a JUnittests exercise,
I'll use this "Testrepository" as the place where all my tests are gathered.
